## version 2.24.1 - 2021/03/19


* [bugfix] Fixes a bug introduced in v2.24.0 where certain datasets wouldn't load

## version 2.24.0 - 2021/03/17

* Frequencies are no longer normalized when the data is lacking.
See [PR 1278](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1278) for more.
* Fixed a stack size bug, which mainly affected the TB dataset on certain browsers.
See [PR 1293](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1293) for more.
* Root-to-tip mutations are now displayed in the tip-clicked info box.
See [PR 1280](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1280) for more.
* Datasets may now define the default language.
See [PR 1303](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1303) for more.
* Polish language added.
See [PR 1288](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1288) for more.
* Tips in the tree should no longer be obscured behind the legend.
See [PR 1302](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1302) for more.
* Dates BCE are now correctly displayed in the phylogeny axis.
See [PR 1297](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1297) for more.


## version 2.23.0 - 2021/01/28
* [feature] Implement genotype filtering.
The sidebar, typing-based filter UI now includes genotypes (for datasets which define mutations on branches).
See [PR 1265](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1265) for more.
* [bugfix] Update how we generate the bundle hashes as the fix introduced in v2.22.2 was insufficient.
See [PR 1272](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1272) for more.

## version 2.22.2 - 2021/01/14
* [bugfix] Updated how we generate hashes for the transpiled, chunked client bundles.
This prevents subtle bugs where bundles could have the same hash, but different contents, and thus stale (browser cached) chunks may be used in certain situations.
This bug most probably arose in v2.22.0, so please update to this version if possible!
See [PR 1263](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1263) for more.

## version 2.22.1 - 2021/01/13
* Updated package-lock JSON file

## version 2.22.0 - 2021/01/11

* The address Auspice uses to fetch map tiles, including the API token, has been updated and will now only work for local installs of auspice.
For help on how to specify your own address, which lets you specify custom map tile sets, see [the Auspice docs](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/auspice/en/stable/customise-client/api.html#specifying-the-api-server-address).
See [PR 1261](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1261) for more.
* Animation controls have moved and are now in the sidebar, underneath the date-slider.
See [PR 1262](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1262) for more.
* The footer has been updated to streamline the Nextstrain accreditation and now displays "Powered by Nextstrain".
If you are serving your own version of auspice we ask for this accreditation to remain be maintained, in keeping with the spirit of scientific citations.
Please also remember that customised version of auspice must make their source code available, as per Auspice's licence.
See [PR 1260](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1260) for more.

## version 2.21.0 - 2021/01/06

### Improved Functionality

* Tree rendering and zooming has been improved.
  * A new **Zoom to Selected** button has been added which allows you to zoom the tree to the clade containing the currently selected tips ([PR 1257](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1257)).
  * Branches ancestral to the common ancestor of the currently selected tips are now correctly rendered ([PR 1248](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1248)).
* The **Download Data** functionality has been improved to export data reflecting the currently viewed subset of data.
Additionally we export annotated Nexus trees which can be parsed by [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
See [PR 1245](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1245) for more.
* The **drag & drop metadata** functionality has been improved to facilitate easier filtering, custom locations and colours.
See [PR 1244](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1244) or [these docs](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/auspice/en/latest/advanced-functionality/drag-drop-csv-tsv.html) for more.
* **Tip labels** are now user-selectable via a drop-down in the sidebar.
See [PR 1246](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1246) for more.
* **Legend values** now dynamically update to reflect those in the current view.
See [PR 1250](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1250) for more.


#### Other Changes

* Italian translation added. See [PR 1256](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1256).
* Amino acid labels are only shown on branches leading to big clades.
See [PR 1249](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1249) for more.
* Colour scale generation has been refactored and a (rare) bug fixed where color-bys which defined a scale in the JSON could cause tips with no trait value set to have a colour rather than a shade of grey.
See [PR 1237](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1237).
* Warnings added to documentation pages which are imported into Nextstrain's (main) RTD project.
See [PR 1234](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1234).
* Disabled a smoke-test which was stochastically failing on GitHub Actions (but which worked locally).
See [PR 1258](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1258) for more.



## version 2.20.1 - 2020/11/19
* Small bugfixes and performance improvements relating to to the features introduced in 2.20.0

## version 2.20.0 - 2020/11/18

See [PR 1200](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1200).
* Add on-hover tooltips to the sidebar to better convey the functionality available.
See [PR 1200](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1200).
* Improve how we space temporal grid lines (phylogeny & frequencies panels).
See [PR 1229](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1229).
* Fix a bug in how we detected HTTP status codes.
See [PR 1226](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1226).
* Auspice documentation is now switched to the Read The Docs platform, and available at https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/auspice.
Redirects have been added for the old GitHub pages site, and can be found in the [redirect-documentation](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/tree/redirect-documentation) branch.
See [PR 1220](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1220).


## version 2.19.0 - 2020/10/07
* The auspice client now makes a request for the root-sequence JSON, which allows colouring of the tree by genotypes where there are no mutations.
See [PR 1197](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1197).
* polyfill `Promise` to avoid crashes in old browsers.
See [PR 1217](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1217).


## version 2.18.4 - 2020/09/28
* (Bugfix) Update dependencies to restore behavior of the leaflet-scroll overlay.
See [nextstrain.org PR #223](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/issues/223) for context, implemented in [PR 1214](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1214)

## version 2.18.3 - 2020/09/22
This version reverts the change to URL parsing introduced in 2.18.2 which broke Auspice on Safari (and perhaps other browsers).

## version 2.18.2 - 2020/09/19
* (Bugfix) Ensure generated SVG ids are escaped correctly. See [PR 1209](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1209).
* Improve parsing of auspice URLs with colon characters in the pathname. See [PR 1210](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1210).

## version 2.18.1 - 2020/08/07
* Add between-paragraph padding for text rendering in (non-mobile) narratives. 

## version 2.18.0 - 2020/08/03
* Parse narratives client side.
See [PR 1193](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1193) and [PR 1172](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1172).
This shifts the default client behavior to request a narrative in markdown format and parse it client-side.
The server still retains the ability to parse narratives server-side and return narratives in JSON format, so there are no breaking changes.

* Narratives can now contain multiple datasets.
See [PR 1193](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1193), [PR 1176](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1176) and [PR 1164](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1164).
Narrative slides may now define their own unique datasets, with datasets preemptively fetched and cached to improve performance.
Invalid datasets will show an error notification and fallback to the dataset defined by the frontmatter of the narrative.

* (Bugfix) Zooming in the entropy panel by using shift/option + mouseWheel now appropriately updates the URL query.
See [PR 1188](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1188)

* (Bugfix) The animation occuring when zooming the phylogeny is now restored.
See [PR 1192](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1192)

## version 2.17.4 - 2020/07/21
* (Bugfix) Improve parsing of narrative files where a regex on a large string (e.g. image encoded as a blob) would hang the server

## version 2.17.3 - 2020/07/14
* (Bugfix) Allow `auspice view` to serve custom auspice client if one exists.
See [PR 1182](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1182).


## version 2.17.2 - 2020/07/13
* (Bugfix) Send error messages in the (HTTP) response body, not the status line.
See [PR 1181](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1181).


## version 2.17.1 - 2020/06/25
* (Bugfix) Metadata from drag-and-drop CSVs now shows up in the color-by menu.
See [PR 1177](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1177).

## version 2.17.0 - 2020/06/19
* You can now toggle whether the data in the frequencies panel is normalized.
See [PR 1158](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1158).
* You can now set the starting state of the transmissions-line toggle via the JSON or a URL query.
See [PR 1152](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1152) and [PR 1165](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1129).
* Improve the caching settings for the auspice server.
See [PR 1146](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1146).
* The performance of Auspice is improved when transmission lines are not rendered.
See [PR 1153](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1153).
* The "narratives" folder is now part of this repo and contains a number of test narratives.
See [PR 1170](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1170) for more details.
* A bug was fixed where narrative slides would sometimes fail to update the tree as expected.
See [PR 1169](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1169).
* A bug was fixed where loading a tree zoomed to a clade would prevent zooming out.
See [PR 1156](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1156).
* A bug was fixed where numeric branch labels couldn't be used as URL queries.
See [PR 1157](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1157).
* The list of allowed nodejs versions was expanded.
See [PR 1166](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1166).

* Since v1.22.3 changing datasets preserved the URL queries (e.g. `?l=radial`).
A number of bugs relating to this have been fixed, where these queries were no longer valid for the new dataset.
This also fixed potential issues related to loading datasets where the URL queries were invalid.
[PR 613](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/613)


## version 1.23.2 - 2018/07/30

## version 1.23.0 - 2018/07/28

* The server no longer needs to be transpiled
* The interaction between data sources (local / staging / live) has been changed.
  * The first part of the URL now defines the source, e.g. /flu is live, /local/flu is local, /staging/flu...
  * Accordingly, `npm run server.js localData` no longer has the effect it used to!
  * Github committed JSONs are now accessible via /community/orgName/repoName (slightly experimental and subject to change)
* JSONs are now delivered to the client using compression (when available)
* Frequency JSONs are only fetched when the frequency panel is specified (in the meta JSON)
* The server combines the tree & meta JSONs into a single "unified" JSON, in preparation for a move to v2.0 JSONs.
* Manifest files / parsing have been moved from the server
* Various improvements to the narratives (still experimental and the API is subject to change)
* Second trees are specified by `/na:ha/` rather than `/na/...?tt=ha`. The old syntax is still supported for backwards compatibility.

* Frequencies added to narrative
* block in focus is part of the URL query, and can be reloaded via the URL

#### Second Tree / Tanglegram
* Second tree can be loaded via a URL (e.g. `?tt=na`). Sidebar dropdown currently disabled.
* In this mode, trees are forced to be rectangular, and the map & frequencies are not displayed.
* Tanglegram exists, but no untangling (yet)
* Bugs still exist (which is why the sidebar has been disabled)

#### Internals
* All JSONs (incl. frequencies, narrative) are loaded within a single Promise & dispatch
* `phylotree.change()` only ever called once, and always in componentDidUpdate (fixes bugs where it fired in both CWRP and CDU)
* old & deprecated code removed

## version 1.14.1 - 2018/02/27
* Style tip stroke separately from branch stroke (`node.stroke` replaced with `node.branchStroke` & `node.tipStroke`)

## version 1.14.0 - 2018/02/27

### Features
* Strain search (using [awesomplete](https://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/)).
This highlights the path to a single tip and increases the tip radius.
Strain is stored in the URL query (`s=...`) and can be restored via URL.
Selected strain also appears in the info panel (top of screen).
* Amino acid branch labels (for every tree) as well as clade labels if specified by the `clade_annotation` attribute.
AA labels are shown where the descendent visible tips account for more than 5% of the total visible tips (same as nextflu).
Clade labels are always displayed.
* Default geneotype gene is now HA1 if available (previously nucleotide).
* ColorBy ordering (sidebar dropdown) is now ordered (via an array in `globals.js`)

### Internals
* The JSON processing on initial load has been shifted from the reducers to a single action - fewer dispatches, fewer potential bugs, faster code.
* Frequencies are initialised in a single action (previously 2).
* tip-frequencies are now downloaded via `get_data.sh`
* Frequency actions are not dispatched unless the frequency panel is loaded.

## version 1.13.2 - 2018/02/26
* Improve consistency of panel controls
* Show `unassigned` in tree legend (if applicable)

## version 1.13.1 - 2018/02/26
* Tree button "reset layout" now at top right

## version 1.13.0 - 2018/02/26

### Features
* Frequencies are now displayed via a stream graph panel - see [PR 497](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/497).
These require the fetching of a separate `tip-frequencies` JSON, and must be specified in the `panels` array of the meta.JSON.
* "Panels To Display" toggles in the sidebar allow customisation of the display, and this is reflected in the URL.
* The `+` `-` buttons in the tree have been replaced by a "reset tree" button.
This resets the bounds to the entire tree & completely re-renders the tree (filters are maintained).
Pan behaviour is unchanged.

### Internals
* React-PhyloTree interface is completely rewritten to use `phylotree.change()` - see [PR 501](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/501) for the API.
The new interface is both easier to understand and quicker.
* `changePageQuery` (used for changing narrative blocks) is now a single action
* Ongoing narrative work (still disabled).
* React sidebar has been removed (no UI changes).

## version 1.12.0 - 2018/02/14

### Features
* Vaccine strains are shown at their use date (in temporal trees), with dotted lines connecting them to their tips (representing collection date) ([PR 498](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/498))

### Internals
* `updateGeometryFade` uses counters to know when transitions are finished rather than `setTimeout`

## version 1.11.0 - 2018/02/05

### Features
* Vaccine strains are now displayed if they are specified in `metaJSON.vaccine_choices` ([PR 490](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/490))

### Internals
* Tree components and PhyloTree have been reorganized (in `src/components/tree`) and the syntax improved ([PR 493](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/493))
* Upgraded to React 16, as well as upgrading redux & react-svg-pan-zoom ([PR 494](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/494))

## version 1.10.0 - 2018/02/05

### Features
* Local Branching Index (LBI) coloring can be calculated in Auspice (code identical to nextflu) if specified in `color_options` (meta JSON) ([PR 491](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/491))

### Internals
* `get_data.sh` script updated to no longer download sequences & entropy JSONs
* action logging middleware available for debugging / development

## version 1.9.0 - 2018/01/30

### Animation
* Animations can now loop! This is selected via a toggle in the sidebar.
* While animating, the URL displays information which defines the animation (bounds, looping, cumulative, speed). This allows the animation to start automatically by linking to this URL.
* The code for the animation (i.e. the setInterval code) has been moved out of `Map` and into a separate `AnimationController` component.
* Animation is stopped & started by examining redux state, rather than with imperative controls.

### misc
* The narrative machinery has been moved forward, but this functionality is still disabled and not present in production code.
* The (rather expensive) `calendarToNumeric` calculations have become part of `state.controls` so that components no longer have to calculate them from the string form.

## version 1.8.0 - 2018/01/18

#### entropy calculated via tree
* The entropy panel data is now computed within Auspice by examining mutations throughout the tree, and is throttled to improve speed under load.
* Both entropy and number of mutations are available via a toggle similar to AA/NT
* This results in `entropy.JSON` no longer being fetched.
* The entropy data is stored in redux state rather than the react component
* The D3 code has been reorganised
* Note that the entropy values are slightly different to those exported by Augur in some situations - see https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/478#issuecomment-358496901

#### genotype calculated via tree
* This results in `sequences.JSON` no longer being fetched.
* Augur was updated to export `annotations` which are needed for entropy gene display.

#### middleware / react router
* All changes to the URL are now performed via middleware rather than side-effects within the action definition.
* React router has been removed
* Browser back/forward is detected via `window.addEventListener('popstate', this.onURLChanged)` which also fires on initial page load.
* Pages are selected via the `<PageSelect>` component.

#### other
* The number of proteins displayed while hovering over a branch has been limited to 7 (issue #484)
* The presence of author data is checked before display (issue #488)
* This changelog has been created and a step in the `releaseNewVersion` script added to prepend the version number upon release.



## version 1.7.2 - 2018/1/4

#### Narrative / situational report
* Functionality has been added, but is currently disabled via a flag in `globals.js`.
* This is currently rendered in a right-hand sidebar. This feature is not yet complete.

#### URL queries

* The following state has been added to the URL query:
  * filters, e.g. `f_authors=Tong_et_al,Capobianchi_et_al&f_division=kerouane`
  * genotype URLs (these were previously set as the URL but not parsed)
  * panel layout (grid/full)
* A number of bugs regarding URL query state parsing (esp with genotype colorBys) have been fixed.

## version 1.7.1 - 2017/10/31

* Added mumps acknowledgment

## version 1.7.0 - 2017/10/17
