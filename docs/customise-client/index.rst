======================================
Customising the Auspice Client
======================================


Auspice allows you to customise the appearance and functionality of Auspice `when the client is built <../introduction/how-to-run.html#auspice-build>`_.
This is how Auspice running locally and nextstrain.org look different, despite both using "Auspice".

*Notice the difference? Default Auspice (left) and nextstrain.org's customised version (right)*


This is achieved by providing a JSON at build time to Auspice which defines the desired customisations via:

 .. code-block:: bash

   auspice build --extend <JSON>


`Here's <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/blob/master/auspice-client/customisations/config.json>`_ the file used by nextstrain.org to change the appearance of Auspice in the above image.


See the `client customisation API <api.html>`_ for the available options.

AGPL Source Code Requirement

Auspice is distributed under `AGPL 3.0 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html>`_.
Any modifications made to the auspice source code, including build-time customisations as described here, must be made publicly available.
