## About Nextstrain

**Nextstrain** is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data.
We provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data with powerful analytics and visualizations showing pathogen evolution and epidemic spread.
Our goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response.

Resulting data and inferences are available live at the website [nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org).

## About Auspice

*Definition: Observation by an augur, ie a prophetic sign.*

**Auspice** is an open-source interactive web app for visualizing phylogenomic data.
It may be used in tandem with nextstrain's bioinformatics toolkit [augur](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur) or on its own.
Auspice may be used to explore datasets locally or run as a server to share results.

## Documentation

The main Nextstrain documentation is available at [docs.nextstrain.org](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/index.html). This includes tutorials, how-to guides, and explanations of concepts to help you get started and answer common questions to achieve your goal(s) with Auspice and other Nextstrain tools.

When getting started with Auspice, it may be helpful to read our [overview of how Auspice fits together with other Nextstrain tools](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/learn/about-nextstrain.html#open-source-tools-for-the-community).

For more detailed technical information how Auspice works and reference guides describing specific Auspice features, check out the Auspice reference-guide documentation at [docs.nextstrain.org/projects/auspice](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/auspice/en/stable/index.html).

## Quickstart

### Installation

See [the relevant page on Auspice docs](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/auspice/en/stable/introduction/install.html).

### Obtain datasets to display

To get up & running, you'll need datasets to visualise.
(Please see the [nextstrain docs](https://nextstrain.org/docs/) for tutorials on how to run your own analyses.)

If you've installed auspice from `npm` you may get datasets to display via:

```bash
mkdir data
curl http://data.nextstrain.org/zika.json --compressed -o data/zika.json
curl http://data.nextstrain.org/ncov.json --compressed -o data/ncov.json
...
```

If you've installed auspice from source, we have a helper script to download a number of datasets for testing:

```bash
# from the auspice src directory
npm run get-data
```

### Obtain narratives to view locally

This repository contains a number of "test narratives" which serve both to provide examples of the capability of narratives, as well as being used to test functionality and fix bugs. 
These should work out of the box, assuming you have obtained the necessary datasets via the above script.

If you wish to view the [nextstrain-maintained narratives](https://nextstrain.org/docs/contributing/sharing-data), then this can be done by checking out the [nextstrain/narratives github repo](github.com/nextstrain/narratives) and telling `auspice` to look for narratives there via the `--narrativeDir` argument.


### Run auspice

```bash
auspice view --datasetDir data
```

And view auspice in the browser at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you are editing source code, running the following command will allow hot-reloading.

```bash
auspice develop --datasetDir data
```

#### Environment variables

The client looks for some environment variables. All are optional.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an incomplete list. For other variables, search for `process.env.` in the codebase.

- `SKIP_REDUX_CHECKS`: Set this to a truthy value to improve dev server responsiveness. Useful when you see a console warning like this:

    > ImmutableStateInvariantMiddleware took 200ms, which is more than the warning threshold of 32ms.
    > If your state or actions are very large, you may want to disable the middleware as it might cause too much of a slowdown in development mode.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)

Run `auspice --help` or `auspice view --help` to see all the available command line options.

### Visual Studio Code Development Container

Auspice development can also occur in a VSCode development container. 

System requirements:
- VSCode on Windows, Mac, or Linux
- Docker


```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice.git
cd auspice
#Ensure the development containers extension is installed
#This can be done via the GUI or through the below command:
code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers

#Open VSCode to the cloned directory.
code .

#Click the remote connection button in the lower left, and pick 'Remote-Container: Reopen in Container'

#Click Terminal->New Terminal. This opens up a command shell inside the development container, then:
#optional
npm run get-data
#optional
npm run get-narratives

#Show that the application functions normally. 
#Run in develop mode and view results in browser (localhost:4000)
auspice develop
```
