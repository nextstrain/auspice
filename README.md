## About Nextstrain

**Nextstrain** is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data.
We provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data with powerful analytics and visualizations showing pathogen evolution and epidemic spread.
Our goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response.

Resulting data and inferences are available live at the website [nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org).

## About Auspice

*Definition: Observation by an augur, ie a prophetic sign.*

**Auspice** is an open-source interactive web app for visualizing phylogenomic data.
It may be used in tandem with nextstrain's bioinformatics toolkit [augur](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur) or on its own.
Auspice may be used to explore datasets locally or run as a server to share results.
