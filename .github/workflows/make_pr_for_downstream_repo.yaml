      # Note that $GITHUB_SHA shouldn't be used here because it refers to the
      # branch HEAD which is not merged with the PR target branch. If the

      # merge ref¹, but we use `workflow_dispatch` to reduce the number of PRs.

            This PR has been created to test this project running Auspice with changes from https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/${{ steps.detect-pr.outputs.pr-number }}.

            Note that Auspice has been installed with changes from both the PR's source and target branches.
            This will surface any issues that can arise from merging the PR in Auspice. To address these issues locally, update the source branch (e.g. with a git rebase).

            This message and corresponding commits were automatically created by a GitHub Action from [nextstrain/auspice](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice).
